Programming Principles 2a 

ASSIGNMENT INCLUDE

- a self-balancing ternary search tree data structure and an unordered
linked list data structure.
  +The linked list and the ternary search tree have a same interface. 
  +The main program can work with either of the two data structures, without modification.

- the Makefile supports two main targets: 
  +one target ("main-list") for building the program with the linked list
  +one target ("main-tree") for building the program with the binary tree
If you do "make all", both targets are build.

- the ternary search tree is required to support inorder, postorder 
and preorder (root->left child->mid child->right child) traversal.

- the 3 traversal functions are able to execute a given function 
on each element (given a function pointer)

- main-tree supports display the whole tree in 3 mode: inorder, preorder and postorder


APPLICATION STRUCTURE

-modular wordfind application with ternary search tree data structure 
to store dictionary words

   source file:
   
      wordfind.c 
      wordset.h 
      wordset.c 
      tstnode.h 
      tstnode.c

   compile with:

      make main-tree

   run with:

      ./main-tree

   operation:

      see ./main-tree -h
